# Mobile Price Classification  
A Mini-project developed for a college assignment. Involves the use of `pandas`, `sklearn` and other popular packages to solve a classification problem of the [Mobile Price Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iabhishekofficial/mobile-price-classification) Dataset from Kaggle

## Packages used:
- `sklearn`
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `seaborn`
- `kaggle`
- `matplotlib`
- `statsmodels`

## Flow of project
- Import calls
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data Cleaning 
- Model definitions and testing (with default parameters)
- Hyperparameter Tuning using `GridSearchCV` on top 2 models
- Model testing with optimized hyperparameters
- Use of both models to predict values of testing dataset
